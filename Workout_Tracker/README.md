### How to use?

  - Download the 4 files necessary for the program to work.
  - Execute the main.py file after downloading the required files.
  - The main classes are divided into separate modules for simplicity and organization.
  - The program is controlled through the "GUI" that appears in the terminal.
  - Be cautious as there are still many bugs that might appear if the inputs are not as expected.
  - The program attempts to create a new file locally for the database.
  - If the program cannot create a new file, it will break.
  - To prevent this, ensure you either execute it with Admin permissions or open all 4 files in VSCode and execute it from there.
