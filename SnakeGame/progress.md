### "Notes"
Project abandoned too annoying and too much of a hassle i know is a simple game but i dont want to have to rebuild everything again just because 1 thing didnt work and i lost motivation on it and just didnt enjoy at all i know im trying to learn but is it worth it if i seriously hate it so much, like it reached a point where i just said whatever i dont want to continue this and just started doing random stuff and everything became a mess and yeah there is no way to continue forwards witout rewriting most of the project and i dont want to do that again for the 3rd time so yeah ABANDONED
